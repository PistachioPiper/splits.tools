# YASA-Yet Another Splits Analyzer
This is my shot at a splits analyzer/custom comparison generator that I'm making for my AP Computer Science Principles project/exam.

## Inspiration:
  - [Splitmaker](https://minibeast.me/splitmaker/) by Minibeast
  - [timeloss.run](https://timeloss.run) by Corvimae

## Goals
  ### Splits Analysis
  - Achieve the same goal as [timeloss.run](https://timeloss.run)
  - Add additional functionality as I'd like
  
  ### Custom Comparison Generation 
  Generate custom comparisons based on your splits as many others have done, factoring in the following:
    - Gold times
    - Average deviation from gold times
    - Relative split reset rate
