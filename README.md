# YASA-Yet Another Splits Analyzer
This is my shot at a splits analyzer/custom comparison generator that I'm making for my AP Computer Science Principles project/exam.

## Inspiration:
  - [Splitmaker](https://minibeast.me/splitmaker/) by Minibeast
  - [timeloss.run](https://timeloss.run) by Corvimae

## Goals
  ### Splits Analysis
  - Achieve the same goal as [timeloss.run](https://timeloss.run)
  - Add additional functionality as I'd like
  
  ### Custom Comparison Generation 
  Generate custom comparisons based on your splits as many others have done, factoring in the following:
  - Gold times
  - Average deviation from gold times
  - Relative split reset rate

## Requirements
  - [ ] Instructions for input from at least one of the following:
    - The user (including user actions that trigger events)
    - A device
    - An online data stream
    - A file

  - [ ] Use of at least one <b>list</b> (or other <b>collection type</b>) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfil the program's purpose

  - [ ] At least one procedure that contributes to the program's intended purpose, where you have defined:
    - The procedure's name
    - The return type (if necessary)
    - One or more parameters

  - [ ] An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure

  - [ ] Calls to your student-developed procedure

  - [ ] Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality
